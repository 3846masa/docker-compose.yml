## SLACK\_ORG and SLACK\_TOKEN env

``SLACK_ORG`` is your team id.

> Your team id is what you use to access your login page on Slack (eg: https://**{this}**.slack.com).

``SLACK_TOKEN`` is your API token.

> You can find your API token at [api.slack.com/web](https://api.slack.com/web) - note that the user you use to generate the token must be an admin.
> You need to create a dedicated ``@slackin-inviter`` user (or similar), mark that user an admin, and use a token from that dedicated admin user.
